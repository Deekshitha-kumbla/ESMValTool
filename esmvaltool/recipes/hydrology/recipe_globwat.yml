    Recipe pre-processes ERA-Interim and ERA-5 data
    for use in the GlobWat hydrological model.
    GlobWat is a Global Hydrological Model provided by FAO
    http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquamaps/

    By default, PET is calculated by the De Bruin method. However, users
    can choose the Langbein method by setting the langbein_pet in the recipe
    to True.

    More information about the De Bruin method can be found at:
    https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-15-0006.1
    More information about the Langbein method can be found at:
    https://doi.org/10.3133/cir52

    The target file has been generated from one of the models sample files
    (prc01wb.asc). The file can be found at:
    http://www.fao.org/geonetwork/srv/en/metadata.show?currTab=simple&id=52366

    Regridding scheme can be choosen from ‘linear’, ‘linear_extrapolate’,
    ‘nearest’, ‘area_weighted’, and ‘unstructured_nearest’.

    The rough cutout preprocessor can be used by users to process the data
    for their desired region. The data will be processed at the global scale 
    if the preprocessor in the recipe is commented.
